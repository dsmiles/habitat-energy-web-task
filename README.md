## Habitat Energy Web Task (Part 2 of 2)

In November/December 2022, I interviewed for the position of Software Engineer in Test at Habitat Energy in Oxford.

As part of the interview process, I undertook a challenge to develop two automation frameworks â€” one for an API and one
for a web UI.

I successfully completed the challenge and the interview process, ultimately receiving an offer for the position in
December 2022. However, I made the decision to decline the offer. In hindsight, I realize I probably should have
accepted it, given the interesting nature of the role. Oh well, live and learn.

The task description is [here](TECHNICAL-TASK.md). The original task description in PDF format is [here](docs/pdf/Software-in-Test-Challenge.pdf).

My list of suggested CI/CD and testing recommendations is here [here](RECOMMENDATIONS.md).

## Framework

I built a UI test framework that combined Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber and Selenium to develop tests
based on acceptance criteria.  The framework also utilises a number of other components for assertions, web driver
management, etc., but Cucumber and Selenium are the main ones.

### BDD Automation with Cucumber

Cucumber is a framework for writing automated tests in a BDD fashion. Its syntax (Gherkin language) allows for more
readable and comprehensive tests which can be understood by any member of the team. Cucumber can be combined with many
API or UI frameworks.

### Selenium

Selenium comes with an array of features, and it supports all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
It also supports all major programming languages, including Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript.

### Page Object Design Pattern

I used the Page Object Design Pattern (POM). POM, is a design pattern that creates an object repository for storing all
web elements. It helps reduce code duplication and improves test case maintenance.

In Page Object Model, you consider each web page of an application as a class file. Each class file will contain only
corresponding web page elements. Using these elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.

## Installation and Prerequisites

The following Java components were used in the test framework:

1. Java JDK 11
2. Maven build manager
3. IntelliJ IDE / or other
4. Required IDE plugins:
    - Maven
    - Cucumber
    - Lombok
    - JUnit / AssertJ
    - Selenium
5. Chrome web browser
6. Firefox web browser

## Running the tests

1. Clone / download the project into your local
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to project location
3. Execute the following Maven command's:

To clean the Maven repository:
- `mvn clean`

To install the Maven requirements / dependencies
- `mvn install`

To execute the test scenarios
- `mvn test`

You can also run the tests from your IDE, by running the Cucumber feature files.

### Pipelines

_This repository was originally hosted in Atlassian BitBucket and used their pipelines. I've since migrated
the repository to GitHub (Jan 2024) so that all of my repositories are in a single location._

I implemented a simple pipeline using BitBucket to run the test suite whenever a changed was pushed to the repository.

The pipeline ran the following:

- Create a Docker contain to run maven:3.6.3 
- Checkout the code from the repository
- Run the following steps in parallel:
  - Build and execute the tests (collecting any results)
  - Perform a security scan on the code (collecting any results)

Note: Atlassian scripts are like GH Actions.
