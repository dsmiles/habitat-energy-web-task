# Software Engineer in Test Challenge

Habitat Energy hosts a multitude of platforms on the cloud in AWS. These platforms could be an API or a UI for our internal teams, or Machine Learning applications with heavy data storage and more.

Your task is to automate the testing of a:

## 1.  Python API application available here:

```https://electricitycosts.org.uk/api-documentation```

Amongst the things to test (non-exhaustive list), you can think of:

- Ensuring API is live
- Ensuring API returns data with parameters
- Ensuring API fails when mandatory parameters are omitted
- But of course, anything else you can think of

## 2. UI Application available here:

```https://www.epexspot.com/en/market-data```

Amongst the thing to test (non-exhaustive list), you can think of:

- Ensuring the data is present on the page (map and prices)
- Ensuring the data is updated with the change filters (map and prices)
- Ensuring the links are working
- But of course, anything else you can think of

To complete the task we must be able to your code to see that it works, so please add documentation to explain how it works.

In addition to that, it would be nice to see your views on the CI/CD steps, or any other recommendations you would have.

If the task is going to take you too long, please send us what you have and write in the documentation what you would do next. Please send us your code as a compress archive e.g. zip, tar.gz, bzip2, etc.

Good luck, and happy coding!
